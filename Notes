* One question remains and how to bundle page element to the objects?


20100419:
* after studying the code of smerf, I found that project bypassed the relations by using 
  a data dump of a form, instead of an individual questions.

* TODO: setup up a example project to demonstrate the EXP below.

* a very good tutorial
http://railscasts.com/episodes/197-nested-model-form-part-2


* about the nested object update
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html#M002132

EXP: make question-to-answer a one-to-many association, also create  a user_id accessor?




TODO: in accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if, I need to check the params['current_user'] or check the session data
TODO: create a user_id accessor on the answers model? 

SUG: ask on forum for a nested resource update with many-to-many filtering situasion.

Q: what's the best practice in view? e.g. for each model, a partial _form?
A:  
 
 
 
TODO: make the survey defining pages a multiple model in one form!


RESEARCH:
http://github.com/alloy/complex-form-examples


Study:
 form_for and fields_for
 

 !!!!!!
SUG: HINT: it probably could be easier if we have sheet-to-answer one-to-many relations,
  the relation tables can be added with additional info like user_id, question_id?? 
  the relation tables can be versioned.
  
  The problem lies in if the answers are corresponding to the questions.
