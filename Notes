Q: what's the best practice in view? e.g. for each model, a partial _form?
A:  
 
 
 
TODO: make the survey defining pages a multiple model in one form!


RESEARCH:

Study:
 form_for and fields_for
 

 !!!!!!
SUG: HINT: it probably could be easier if we have sheet-to-answer one-to-many relations,
  the relation tables can be added with additional info like user_id, question_id?? 
  the relation tables can be versioned.
  
  The problem lies in if the answers are corresponding to the questions.
