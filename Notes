  sequence number

* [TODO] allow user to later assign 'section' value for each question, therefore closer to the layout of the page.


* [ESP.TODO] basic i18n setup

* [TODO] try to using authrorization 
		http://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization/blob/master/README.rdoc

	>>>> Q: I wonder if the authorization is based on declaration, then how to manage those via web front, otherwise I will have to log onto the server to get things

* [TODO] nested resource survey and its section and question can not be shown/edited correctly.

* [TODO] administration role of managing all users survey.
	>>>> INFO: after investigating plugin, declarative_authorization, the weakness
		 is it did not support online privilege editing. 
		 Considering the later user magmt, admin function will still use
		 role_requirement plugin, which has some limit when extending with new roles to be defined.
		 [INFO] supposingly we only utilize 3 roles, admin, leader, user(normal)
		 [INFO] the access logic will not configurable, but embedded in the each 
		 		controller, 
		 [AFM] See if it's easy and possible to let roles in 'declarative_authorization'
		       editable.
		 
	>>>> Originally the online editing function is provided by the plugin role-requirement,
		 but railcast#17 has much info



* [TODO] find a better way to implement the page layout "Section", hopefully
         not the nested resources.
         

* [Q] How to put the rating into the center of the page?
  [A] 
 
* [TODO] since we provide sheet history version, so edit page should allow the user to load/edit previous version. 
		Though it's quite not convinient to see the difference.
	>>>> [TRY] input a version id as an edit parameter, load all response between 
	            the timestamps of that version and previous one(if not the first)
	
	>>>> [IDEA] I think it's not a good idea to load previous survey responses(responses)
				either for user or admin to modify the latest one. Too easy makes things
				non serious. Now just viewing.
				
	>>>> 


* [Q] I wonder if the cellphone page how to help re-arrange the action code?
  [A] 

* [Done] forward user to the the 'Employee Form' survey after logged in, rather than let user choose existing one.
    >>>> created ApplicationController#forward_to_employee_form for temporary use
    >>>> UserController, SessionController have references
    
* [TODO] modify the survey entry page, move out the version and make the version related to the survey instead of each question
	>>>> 

* [TODO] format the page with better design. 
	>>>>

* about print, it looks like that we need to create another action to handle the 'Print' action.


20100510
* added Google translate api by example:
  http://ruby.geraldbauer.ca/google-translation-api.html

* it's quite uncomfortable to use id as a survey_def_id in SurveySheetController#show
I can either change the link to the modification page by changing following code,
<td><%= link_to 'Edit', survey_sheet_url(sheet.id), :survey_id => sheet.survey.id %></td>

   try to make survey, survey_sheet resourceful, so that we can call it like survey_sheet/?survey_id=3 

   create a resourceful sheet and 




20100423
* though we'd like to use resourceful to handle editing, I found it difficult to make a new def
 into a sheet. 

 I think it would be better if URL would be like 'http://localhost:3000/survey_sheets/?survey=1'
 instead of http://localhost:3000/survey_sheets/1 (1=> the id of survey definition)

* Since one survey 


* modify the acts_as_versioned.rb line 120, change 'Inflector' to 'ActiveSupport::Inflector'

* INFO: discard the acts_as_versioned and begin to use verion_fu because the dirty update?
 start trying http://github.com/jmckible/version_fu


* Regarding the requirement of multiple user editing, I am thinking of introducing the role
based functions
 e.g. questions answer only by some people(people belongs to a group, )

20100419:
* after studying the code of smerf, I found that project bypassed the relations by using

Q: what's the best practice in view? e.g. for each model, a partial _form?
A:  
 
 
 
TODO: make the survey defining pages a multiple model in one form!


RESEARCH:
http://github.com/alloy/complex-form-examples


Study:
 form_for and fields_for
 

 !!!!!!
SUG: HINT: it probably could be easier if we have sheet-to-answer one-to-many relations,
  the relation tables can be added with additional info like user_id, question_id?? 
  the relation tables can be versioned.
  
  The problem lies in if the answers are corresponding to the questions.

Please have a look at the document: 
\\spicyfile\SpicyHorse\human_resources\Evals\Evaluation_Form.doc
The purpose of the document is to drive more communication within the studio  and share the information of whether all employees are happy or not.We need to  make it a online survey system so that everyone can participate in it much  easier.

Requirements:

5 web pages: survey edit page, survey view page, employee survey list page,  survey result(statistics) page, main page
database: store the survey result and history of every modification in mysql  server on spicydata

survey edit page( high priority)
     It contains the content in Evaluation_Form.doc pre-filled with the last  submitted modification(empty for the first time). Employees/managers should be  able to modify the content and submit to server. Every submisson(modification)  to the form should be saved in the employee's database as a new version. The  server should be able to recognize who submit the form by windows login name  and which employee's form it is by page context.

survey view page( medium priority)
     It displays the emplyee's last modified survey form and the name of who  made the modification(the employee or his manager). At the bottom of this page  there should be a list of links of the previous versions.

employee survey list page(high priority)
    It lists the all the employee's name with links to the edit page and the  view page. Only managers have access to this page(to be considered).

survey result(statistics) page(medium priority)
    It display the average scores of all employee's last submitted form.

main page
   A brief introduction of the survey and links to the other 4 pages.

The system will be deployed on spicydata with a link in spicy WIKI.

Please talk to chenbaowu if more detail required.
